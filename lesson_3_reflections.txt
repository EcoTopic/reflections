#What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git dir is made with where metadata about the files in the parent dir can be stored.

$ git init

# to see the status of the .git dir
$ git status

# to add file to staging area:

$ git add file.txt
$ git add file2.txt

# to remove a file from staging area
$ gir reset file.txt

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains the files that you want to track, they form the repository. The value this offers is that the working directory can contain other files that do not have to be part of the repository.
