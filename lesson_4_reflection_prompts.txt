# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  For backup, work from different computers, work with more contributors.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You might get conflicts while working locally. non-logical commits?
  
# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  branch: on a single repo. to try out new feature without breaking the master
  clone: copy another repo either from github or another location on your own machine to work on separately without the need to get back to orginal
  fork: copy another repo with reference to the original.
